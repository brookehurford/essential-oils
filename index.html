      <h2>What are essential oils?</h2>
      <p>An essential oil is the &#34;lifeblood&#34; of a plant. The oil protects the plant from disease, provides nutrients, and helps to repel insects. For thousands of years, they have been used to bring health and healing to the body in a lot of ways - physically, spiritually, mentally and emotionally. EO molecules work because they are so damn small that they can pass through our skin, organs, BBB (Blood Brain Barrier). When this happens they will proceed to provide our body with it's own unique healing attributes.</p>
